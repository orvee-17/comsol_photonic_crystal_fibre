# Photonic Crystal Fibre Study using Comsol Multiphysics
This project is a part of the coursework of EEE- 4518 where we studied about the structure of photonic crystal fibre and its use. COMSOL software was used to implement this project as it is difficult to implement practical projects on photonic crystal fibre.

In this project, we designed our own photonic crystal fibre which has a high negative dispersion coefficient. This high negative dispersion coefficient helped to reduce the confinement  loss that exists in photonic crystal fibers. We also extended this idea into Terahertz frequency generation using our crsytal fibre as terahertz radiation has a lot of advantages in biomedical, communication etc sectors. The presentation and comsol files of the project are given.
